Many people dread running, but there is plenty of evidence that supports reasons to lace up your sneakers and hit the road.
There are several benefits to going on a quick run even just a few times a week. Three of my favorite benefits are: <ul><li>it makes you happier</li><li>strengthens your bones</li><li>keeps you fit</li></ul>

<p> Accoding to Runners World Magazine, just 30 minutes of running can increase your mood instantly. Also, running decreases anxiety and depression symptoms. </p>
<p>Obviously running burns many calories, about a 100 a mile. The more calories you burn the more food you can eat later!</p>
